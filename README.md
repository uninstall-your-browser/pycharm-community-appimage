# What is the difference between the "community edition" and the "unified" version?

Previously, jetbrains had 2 versions of IDEA/Pycharm - "community" and "ultimate". Recently, they have taken the ultimate edition, and renamed it to the "unified" edition, promoting it as the freemium version of the IDEs. On their website, they have made it very difficult to download the community edition, but it is still available on their [github](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/). The unified version includes propriatery components, such as the AI assistant and also includes nags such as the green "start free trial" button which is intentionally not hideable.

For the "unified" version, see https://github.com/uninstall-your-browser/pycharm-appimage
