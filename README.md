# What is the difference between the "community edition" and the "unified" version?

> Previously, there were two versions available for download - IntelliJ IDEA Community and IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate - with a clear and honest comparison between them.
Later, the download page started offering IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate by default, and finding IntelliJ IDEA Community required literally scrutinizing the page with a magnifying glass.
Now the download page features a trimmed-down version of IDEA Ultimate that has simply been renamed. - [youtrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-222323/Green-Start-Free-Trial-button-cannot-be-removed.-Visual-distraction.#focus=Comments-27-13242013.0-0)

For a free user, the biggest difference is the absense of the [green "start free trial" button](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-222323/Green-Start-Free-Trial-button-cannot-be-removed.-Visual-distraction.) in the community edition.
